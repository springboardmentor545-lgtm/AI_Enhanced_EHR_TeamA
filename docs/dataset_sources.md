# Dataset Sources – Team A: EHR Imaging Documentation System

This project integrates multiple medical imaging modalities and electronic health record (EHR) datasets to build an EHR-Imaging Documentation System. The datasets uploaded in this repository provide both structured clinical records and unstructured imaging data that can be combined for multimodal analysis.

## EHR Datasets

1. The dataset used in this project is Synthea-style synthetic EHR data.
It follows the structure and conventions used in Synthea-generated datasets, but it was customized and refined for this project.
No real patient data was used.
