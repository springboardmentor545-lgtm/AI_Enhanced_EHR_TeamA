# AI-Powered Enhanced EHR Imaging & Documentation System:

An advanced healthcare application that integrates Generative AI with Electronic Health Records (EHR) to enhance medical imaging, automate clinical documentation, and improve ICD-10 coding accuracy. The system leverages Azure OpenAI, Computer Vision, and APIs to streamline clinical workflows, reduce administrative workload, and improve diagnostic efficiency.

## Milestone 1 — Data Collection & Preprocessing

### Steps to Prepare the Dataset
1.Collect datasets

Search open sources like Kaggle, PhysioNet, NIH.
Download MRI, CT, and EHR datasets that are openly licensed.
The data sources are mentioned in docs/dataset_sources.md
2.Organize into folders

Create a root project folder.
Inside it, keep two main folders: images and ehr_notes.
Name files properly (for example: MRI_001.png, CT_002.png, note_001.txt).
3.Data cleaning and Preprocessing
 
. Remove corrupted, duplicate, or unreadable image files.
. Standardize image formats (e.g., convert to PNG/JPEG).
. Organize images into structured directories by modality and Validate image-label mappings.
. Handle missing values in patient demographics, diagnoses, and procedures.
. Standardize column names across files (patient ID, age, sex).
. Normalize categorical values (e.g., M/F vs Male/Female).

### Challenges faced
. Variability in image quality and resolution across datasets (X-ray, CT, MRI, Ultrasound).
. Non-standard naming conventions and folder structures and Labeling inconsistencies.
. Handling sensitive health data responsibly and ensuring compliance.
. Combining structured (EHR) and unstructured (imaging) datasets for multimodal AI models.
. High storage requirements for large imaging datasets.
