# Milestone 4: Integration and Deployment  
**AI-Powered Enhanced EHR Imaging & Documentation**

---

## Module Objective
Integrate and deploy AI-enhanced EHR outputs into a clinician-facing interface that simulates real-world clinical workflows and supports efficient review of medical records.

---

## Overview
Milestone 4 represents the integration and deployment layer of the project. It consolidates AI-enhanced medical imaging, AI-generated clinical documentation, and ICD-10 diagnostic coding into a single, interactive dashboard designed for clinical review.

This milestone focuses on deploying and visualizing outputs generated in earlier modules rather than performing new AI inference.

---

## Alignment with Module 4 Requirements
- Deployment of AI-generated outputs into a real-time, interactive frontend  
- Integration of enhanced imaging and documentation into an EHR-style workflow  
- Delivery of a deployment-ready prototype suitable for clinical demonstration  
- Data structures designed to be compatible with hospital EHR systems  

---

## Key Features
- Patient record selection  
- Display of AI-enhanced medical images  
- Visualization of AI-generated clinical notes and assessments  
- ICD-10 diagnosis code and description  
- Clean, healthcare-oriented user interface  
- Ethical disclaimer for clinical decision support  

---

## Technology Stack
- Streamlit (Frontend)  
- Python  
- Pillow (Image handling)  
- JSON (Data format)  
- Azure OpenAI (Referenced AI backend from previous modules)

}
```

## Running the application
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py

---

## Scope

This milestone focuses on frontend integration and deployment. It demonstrates how AI-enhanced EHR outputs can be presented within clinical workflows but does not connect to live hospital systems.

---

## Ethical Disclaimer

This system assists clinicians by presenting AI-generated insights and does not replace professional medical judgment.

---

## Outcome

Milestone 4 completes the pipeline by deploying AI-generated outputs into a clinician-facing dashboard, demonstrating practical integration of AI into EHR workflows.
